This repository documents my hands-on journey through classical cryptography concepts, implemented from scratch in Python to build strong fundamentals in encryption, transformation logic, and security thinking.
The focus of this project is understanding how ciphers work, why most of them are insecure today, and how these ideas evolve into modern security practices used in real systems.
This is a learning-first repository — not a production crypto library.

## Goals of This Repository

Build a solid understanding of classical ciphers
Learn how keys, transformations, and patterns work
Understand why classical ciphers fail
Bridge the gap between toy ciphers and real-world security
Develop the mindset needed for Blue Team / SOC / Incident Response

### While classical ciphers are no longer used for real security, they introduce concepts that appear everywhere in modern systems:

Encryption vs hashing
Key management
Pattern leakage
Layered defenses
Attacker abuse of encryption (ransomware, C2 traffic)

### This repository lays the groundwork for deeper study in:

Secure authentication
Password hashing & salting
Network security
Incident response

## Disclaimer

All implementations in this repository are for educational purposes only.

Do not use these ciphers to protect real data.
For real applications, always use well-reviewed cryptographic libraries.
